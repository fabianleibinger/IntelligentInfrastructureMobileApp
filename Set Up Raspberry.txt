1. Raspberry Pi Imager https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/

2. Use Raspberry Pi Imager to create a bootable SD-Card with Raspberry Pi OS Lite.

3. Reconnect your SD-Card and create an empty file called "ssh" with no file extension

4. Load the SD-Card into your Raspberry Pi and fire it up.

(4.1 get the IP address of your Pi) not necessary if you use raspberrypi.local in step 5


//// on the PI ////

5. connect via SSH (raspberrypi.local) username: pi, password: raspberry

6. change password

// adjust the static ip of eth0 if you want
7. printf "\ninterface wlan0 \n    static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24 \n    nohook wpa_supplicant \n\ninterface eth0 \n    static ip_address=192.168.0.20/24 \n    static routers=192.168.0.1" | sudo tee -a /etc/dhcpcd.conf

8. sudo apt update / sudo apt upgrade / sudo reboot


//// on your machine ////

9. move your own client.ovpn file (from the FZI VPN) into /home/pi i.e. with SCP (scp LOCALPATH/client.ovpn pi@IP_ADDRESS:/home/pi)
9.1 move setupPi.sh into /home/pi i.e. with SCP (scp LOCALPATH/setupPi.sh pi@IP_ADDRESS:/home/pi)


//// on the PI ////

10. sudo bash setupPi.sh (ca. 60min)

11. bash catkin_ws/setup_script.sh

// Shutdown the server with catkin_ws/shutdown_script.sh
// Start standalone server with simulated Parkhaus-Management-System with catkin_ws/setup_script_standalone.sh
